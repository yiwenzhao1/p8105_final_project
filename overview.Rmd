  Gotham City, a city of sin that exists in comic and film works, is wildly considered to be created based on New York. This is because from a lexical history perspective, Gotham City is an alias for New York. This alias first appeared in Washington Irving's mocking periodical "Salmagundi" in 1807. Frank Miller, the author of Batman's Dark Knight Revisited, also said, "Metropolis is New York by day; Gotham City is New York by night."
  
  However, the longtimde author of Batman series Neal Adams thought  Gotham City was more like Chicago-based in the early comics. A city that combines prosperity with high crime rates. From the towering skyscrapers to the trash-strewn back alleys. Brilliant neon lights at night  can't hide the darkness beneath the glitz. These characteristics of Chicago set the tone for Gotham City, the shadowy capital of evil.
  
  Due to a shooting case that happened in Chicago recently, the crime rates in different areas of Chicago caught our attention. Violent incidents in Chicago are of increasing concern over the last few years, and we are interested in looking at what might be associated with increased violence in Chicago. We are concerned about people’s living safety in the city and motivated to find safer neighborhoods for living in Chicago.

  Apart from that, news came that Zheng, a 24-year-old native of of China’s Sichuan province, was shot and killed on November 9th during a robbery in the 900 block of East 54th Place, which was in the vicinity of University of Chicago's campus. As his compatriots, we were all overwhelmed by unbearable sorrow and loss. And such tragedies kept occuring every now and then. Therefore, our concern towards the crimes in Chicago grew.

## **Data**

#### **Data Source**

6-year Chicago Crime data records are retrieved from Chicago’s official public data [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org). 

* 6-year Chicago crime data records (2016 - 2021):
  - [2016](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2016/kf95-mnd6/data)
  - [2017](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2017/d62x-nvdr/data)
  - [2018](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2018/3i3m-jwuy/data)
  - [2019](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2019/w98m-zvie/data)
  - [2020](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2020/qzdf-xmn8/data)
  - [2021](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2021/dwme-t96c/data)

This dataset reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2006 to present, minus the most recent seven days. Data is extracted from the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. In order to protect the privacy of crime victims, addresses are shown at the block level only and specific locations are not identified.  Each record represents one criminal case. This dataset contains approximately 2 million crime records and details 22 variables such as ID, number, data, neighborhood, IUCR, and primary type for each case.

#### **Data Processing and Clean**

First we eliminated missisng variables and cleaned the variable names to lower_case names. Then, we tried to filter "arrest" and "domestic" data to select non-domestic closed cases. Since each year's criminal records are contained in a separate dataset respectively, we created a tidy dataframe containing all criminal records from 2017 to 2021. Also, since our analysis will include some predictions for trend, we split variable "data" and composed new variables as "year","month", and "day" respectively to facilitate our analysis of trends for each year. Here is our data process:

```{r roughly data cleaning, eval = FALSE}
# clean data 
crime_2017 =
   read.csv("./data/Crimes_-_2017.csv") %>% 
   drop_na() %>% 
   janitor::clean_names() %>%
   filter(arrest=="true",domestic=="false")
crime_2018 =
   read.csv("./data/Crimes_-_2018.csv") %>% 
   drop_na() %>% 
   janitor::clean_names() %>%
   filter(arrest=="true",domestic=="false")
crime_2019 =
   read.csv("./data/Crimes_-_2019.csv") %>% 
   drop_na() %>% 
   janitor::clean_names() %>%
   filter(arrest=="true",domestic=="false")
crime_2020 =
   read.csv("./data/Crimes_-_2020.csv") %>% 
   drop_na() %>% 
   janitor::clean_names() %>%
   filter(arrest=="true",domestic=="false")
crime_2021 =
   read.csv("./data/Crimes_-_2021.csv") %>% 
   drop_na() %>% 
   janitor::clean_names() %>%
   filter(arrest=="true",domestic=="false")

five_year_data=
   do.call("rbind",list(crime_2017,crime_2018,crime_2019,crime_2020,crime_2021)) %>% 
   mutate(
      date=strptime(date, "%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p"),
      date=as.Date(date,"%Y-%m-%d"),
      year = as.numeric(format(date, format = "%Y")),
      month = as.numeric(format(date, format = "%m")),
      month=month.abb[month],
      day = as.numeric(format(date, format = "%d"))
      ) %>% 
   relocate(year,month,day,.before = date)
write.csv(full_df,file="./data/five_year_data.csv")
```

The part of resulting data `five_year_data` used for analysis can be viewed below, showing the latest cases.

```{r echo=FALSE}
show_data = read.csv("./data/five_year_data.csv")
datatable(tail(show_data,100), rownames = FALSE, filter = "top", 
          options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX = T, Width = 100))

```

#### **Data Description**

The resulting data file of `data_clean` contains 184349 criminal records and 24 variables.
The list below is the description of our interested variables:
 
 * `data`. The date of occurrence of crime.
 * `block`. The block where the crime occurred.
 * `primary_type`. The primary description of crime.
 * `description`. Detail description to the crime.
 * `location decription`. Detail description about where the crime occurred.
 * `latitude`. The latitude of occurrence of crime.
 * `longitude`. The longitude of occurrence of crime.

The data file of `weather` containing the detail weather conditions, such as temperature, dew, humidity etc. from July 1st to July 31th in Chicago. We will use this dataset to explore the association between weather and criminal incidence in Chicago. 
`weather` dataset was retrieved from [Weather Query Builder.](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather/weather-data-services)

## **Research Questions**
   In our study, we aim to investigate how does the crime amount change over these 5 years? Is there any significant change in the number of crimes? What are the possible reasons that cause the change? In what kind of location in Chicago does the most amount of crime happen? Which type of crime is most likely to occur in Chicago?
In addition, we want to explore the association between weather and the number of crime occurring in Chicago.
   Through our visual analytics, we can quickly analyze crime incidents and find patterns related to crime incidents to provide inspiration to preventing crime, which can helping Chicago to effectively improve the occurrence of crime incidents and help them create a safer city.

## **Main Results**

      How does the crime amount change over these 5 years? Is there any significant change in the number of crimes?What are the possible reasons that cause the change?

According to our study, in 2017, 2018, 2019, and the first two months in 2020, there is a much higher density of crimes happened during the year. The crime case density drops rapidly in the middle of March in 2020 and reaches the lowest point in April 2020. The crime rate has a significant increase in 2020, and the significant increase of crime in Chicago is probably associated with the COVID-19 prevalence.


      Which type of crime is most likely to occur in Chicago? In what kind of location in Chicago does the most amount of crime happen?


The most frequently occurring type of crime in Chicago from 2017 to 2021 is narcotics, followed by weapons violation, theft, battery, assault, other offense, and criminal trespass etc.Also, our animated bar graph shows that streets and sidewalks are the locations with high crime rates during the five-year period.


      Is there any association between weather and the number of crime occurring in Chicago?

 Unfortunately, there is no evidence to show there is a direct association between weather condition and criminal incidence.

## **Conclusion**

The crime rate kept shockingly high in the first 3 years. Even in the first semester of 2020, it followed the same trend as preceding years. Then, as the pandemic broke out, the number of crimes cases dramtically fell as a result of lockdown policy, which was a quite safer time compared to the ordinary days.

As the line graph shows, it is common that hundreds of crime cases happen in Chicago almost every day, especially summer time starting from May to August when the crime rates can reach high peaks. Among them, narcotics, weapons violations, battery and theft consist of the most frequent criminal types. Besides, streets and sidewalks, where there are few shelters and individuals are easily exposed, are the most dangerous locations.

Thus, in case of unexpected violence, here we provide some suggestions to properly protect yourselevs. Firstly, stay home after sunset. Secondly, stay away from crossroads, try to use the shelters around to avoid being targeted. Be alert to the dark streets.
